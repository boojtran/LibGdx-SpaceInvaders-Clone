# Space Invaders Clone - Bounding Boxes Only #

Having some trouble with data structures for the alien group, and the collision detection for when the bullets hits them: **GameWorld.java** is where I did all the data structure and collision stuff. **WARNING!** Might cause real programmers to throw upon seeing the way I did the control flow for the collision.

## Controls For the Prototype ##

A and D - Move left and right respectively
J - Fire bullets
